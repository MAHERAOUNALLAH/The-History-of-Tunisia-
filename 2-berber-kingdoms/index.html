      <h2>🪶 Berber Origins in Tunisia</h2>
      <p>Long before Carthage and Rome, the Imazighen inhabited the lands of present-day Tunisia. These indigenous people settled in the mountainous regions and desert fringes, building early communities based on livestock herding, foraging, and localized trade.</p>

      <h2>🐐 Livelihood and Settlement</h2>
      <p>The Berbers in Tunisia adopted a semi-nomadic lifestyle, raising goats, sheep, and camels. Over time, many settled and created troglodyte homes, such as those in Matmata. These communities became the backbone of early Amazigh civilization in the region.</p>

The legendary Jugurtha’s campaigns even extended into Tunisian lands, showcasing the region's military and political relevance.</p>
