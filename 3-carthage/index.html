                <h2>The Carthaginian Empire</h2>
                <p>Carthage, founded by Phoenician colonists in the 9th century BCE, grew to become the dominant maritime power in the Mediterranean. Located in modern-day Tunisia, Carthage established a vast commercial empire with colonies across North Africa, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and Spain.</p>

                <p>The Carthaginians were renowned for their advanced naval technology, impressive harbor engineering, and prosperous trade networks that stretched across the Mediterranean world. Their capital city featured a double harbor system that was considered an engineering marvel of the ancient world.</p>

                <h2> Polybios: Historian of Carthage</h2>
                <p>The Greek historian Polybios (c. 200â€“118 BCE) provides our most complete contemporary account of Hannibal's campaigns and the Punic Wars. As a political hostage in Rome, he gained unique access to Roman and Carthaginian sources, creating balanced historical records that remain invaluable today.</p>

                <h2>Hannibal's Legacy</h2>
                <p>Hannibal Barca (247-183 BCE), son of Hamilcar Barca, is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history. His most famous achievement was leading the Carthaginian army, including war elephants, across the Alps to attack Rome during the Second Punic War (218-201 BCE).</p>

                        <p>Hannibal won several decisive victories against Rome, including the Battle of Cannae where he encircled and annihilated a much larger Roman force.</p>

                    <li>Advanced shipbuilding and navigation techniques</li>

                    <li>A unique political system with elected leaders (Suffetes) and councils</li>
                    <li>Impressive architecture including the circular military harbor (Cothon)</li>
                    <li>Religious practices centered on deities like Baal Hammon and Tanit</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Despite Rome's systematic destruction of Carthage, archaeological excavations in modern Tunisia continue to reveal the grandeur of this ancient civilization, including the famous Tophet sanctuary and the Antonine Baths.</p>

                <p>At the heart of this vast empire stood its namesake capital, Carthage, strategically positioned on the Gulf of Tunis. This aerial view reveals the city's legendary dual harbors - the outer commercial port welcoming ships from across the Mediterranean, and the inner circular Cothon that sheltered Carthage's formidable navy. The towering Byrsa citadel, visible at center, housed the city's most sacred temples and served as the political nucleus where suffetes (elected leaders) governed. Notice how the city walls extend toward the fertile hinterlands that fed Carthage's population of half a million, while seaward fortifications protected against naval assaults.</p>
